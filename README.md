# üìò SQL Challenge - Formatting Names with Occupation Initials
This repository contains my solution to a classic SQL problem that requires formatting names from a database and appending the first letter of their occupation in parentheses.

## üß© Problem Statement
- Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
- Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order

## üóÇ Table Structure
The OCCUPATIONS table has the following columns:
| Column         | Type    |
|----------------|---------|
| Name   | String  |
| Occupation       | String  |

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Breakdown
I solved this problem by breaking it down into manageable steps:

**Part 1**

**1. Sort names alphabetically**

<pre>SELECT Name 
FROM OCCUPATIONS 
ORDER BY Name ASC;</pre>

**2. Extract the first letter of the occupation**

<pre>SELECT SUBSTRING(Occupation, 1, 1) 
FROM OCCUPATIONS;</pre>

**3. Wrap the first letter in parentheses**

<pre>SELECT CONCAT('(', SUBSTRING(Occupation, 1, 1), ')') 
FROM OCCUPATIONS;</pre>

**4. Combine name and formatted occupation**

<pre>SELECT CONCAT(Name, CONCAT('(', SUBSTRING(Occupation, 1, 1), ')')) 
FROM OCCUPATIONS 
ORDER BY Name ASC;</pre>

SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ',COUNT(Occupation),' ', Occupation, 's.')
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY Occupation 
ORDER BY COUNT(Occupation) ASC;

**Part 2**

**1. Count Occupation**
<pre>SELECT COUNT(Occupation)
FROM OCCUPATIONS;</pre>

**2. Combine total occupation with required format**

<pre>SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ',COUNT(Occupation),' ', Lower(Occupation), 's.')
FROM OCCUPATIONS;</pre>

**3 Group and order by occupation**

<pre>SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ',COUNT(Occupation),' ', Lower(Occupation), 's.')
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY Occupation 
ORDER BY COUNT(Occupation) ASC;</pre>


## üß† Key SQL Functions Used
- CONCAT() - To merge strings
- SUBSTRING() - To extract a portion of the occupation string
- ORDER BY - To alphabetize the results

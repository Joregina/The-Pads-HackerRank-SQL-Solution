# üìò SQL Challenge ‚Äì Formatting Names with Occupation Initials
This repository contains my solution to a classic SQL problem that requires formatting names from a database and appending the first letter of their occupation in parentheses.

## üß© Problem Statement
Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in the OCCUPATIONS table, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession enclosed in parentheses.

## üóÇ Table Structure
The OCCUPATIONS table has the following columns:
Name ‚Äì The name of the person
Occupation ‚Äì The person's job title (Doctor, Professor, Singer, Actor)

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Breakdown
I solved this problem by breaking it down into manageable steps:

**1. Sort names alphabetically**

SELECT Name 
FROM OCCUPATIONS 
ORDER BY Name ASC;

**2. Extract the first letter of the occupation**

SELECT SUBSTRING(Occupation, 1, 1) 
FROM OCCUPATIONS;

**3. Wrap the first letter in parentheses**

SELECT CONCAT('(', SUBSTRING(Occupation, 1, 1), ')') 
FROM OCCUPATIONS;

**4. Combine name and formatted occupation**

SELECT CONCAT(Name, CONCAT('(', SUBSTRING(Occupation, 1, 1), ')')) 
FROM OCCUPATIONS 
ORDER BY Name ASC;







üß† Key SQL Functions Used
CONCAT() ‚Äì To merge strings
SUBSTRING() ‚Äì To extract a portion of the occupation string
ORDER BY ‚Äì To alphabetize the results

‚úÖ Final Output
